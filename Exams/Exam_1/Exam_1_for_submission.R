# **I.**
#   **Read the cleaned_covid_data.csv file into an R data frame. (20 pts)**
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("./cleaned_covid_data.csv")
df

#   **II.**
#   **Subset the data set to just show states that begin with "A" and save this as an object called A_states. (20 pts)**
A_states <- subset(df,grepl("^A",df$Province_State))
A_states


#   + Use the *tidyverse* suite of packages
# + Selecting rows where the state starts with "A" is tricky (you can use the grepl() function or just a vector of those states if you prefer)


# **III.**
#   **Create a plot _of that subset_ showing Deaths over time, with a separate facet for each state. (20 pts)**
ggplot(A_states,aes(x=Last_Update,y=Deaths))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="loess",se=FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~Province_State,scales="free")+
  labs(title="Deaths vs Time",
       x="Last Updated")
 
# + Create a scatterplot
# + Add loess curves WITHOUT standard error shading
# + Keep scales "free" in each facet


# **IV.** (Back to the full dataset)
# **Find the "peak" of Case_Fatality_Ratio for each state and save this as a new data frame object called state_max_fatality_rate. (20 pts)**
state_max_fatality_rate <- df %>% 
  group_by(Province_State) %>% 
  slice(which.max(Case_Fatality_Ratio)) %>%
  ungroup()
state_max_fatality_rate

#   I'm looking for a new data frame with 2 columns:
New_df <- state_max_fatality_rate %>% 
   arrange(desc(Case_Fatality_Ratio)) %>% 
  select(Province_State,Maximum_Fatality_Ratio=Case_Fatality_Ratio)
New_df

#  + "Province_State"
#  + "Maximum_Fatality_Ratio"
#  + Arrange the new data frame in descending order by Maximum_Fatality_Ratio
# This might take a few steps. Be careful about how you deal with missing values!



# **V.**
# **Use that new data frame from task IV to create another plot. (20 pts)**
ggplot(New_df,aes(x=reorder(Province_State,-Maximum_Fatality_Ratio),
                  y =Maximum_Fatality_Ratio))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill='blue',color='black')+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,color='red'))+
  labs(title=" Maximum Fatality by State",
       x="State",
       y="Maximum Fatality Ratio by State")
  
#  + X-axis is Province_State
#  + Y-axis is Maximum_Fatality_Ratio
#  + bar plot
#  + x-axis arranged in descending order, just like the data frame (make it a factor to accomplish this)
#  + X-axis labels turned to 90 deg to be readable
#  
# Even with this partial data set (not current), you should be able to see that (within these dates), different states had very different fatality ratios.
# 
# **VI.** (BONUS 10 pts)
# **Using the FULL data set, plot cumulative deaths for the entire US over time**


#  + You'll need to read ahead a bit and use the dplyr package functions group_by() and summarize() to accomplish this.
